# Capital Steez RIP
A full stack application that was made for fans of Capital Steez. Courtney Jamal Dewar, Jr. (July 7, 1993 â€“ December 23, 2012) was an American hip hop artist from Brooklyn, New York better known by his stage name Capital Steez (stylized as Capital STEEZ). He was the founder of the Brooklyn-based rap collective Pro Era, along with longtime friend and record producer Powers Pleasant. REST IN PEACE CAPITAL STEEZ.

## Installation
1. Clone my repo
2. Open your terminal and  run `npm install` to download the necessary node modules

## Usage
1. Once everything is downloaded, in the terminal run `npm run steez`
2. Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:9000` you should now be able to see and use my application! :)


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, EJS
Under the Hood: This is a simple application with the concept of CRUD in mind. Using node, express modules, MongoDB and the server localhost 3000 I was able to connect the front and back ends. Initially while running command line all updates were made with node server.js, this was tedious and I eventually installed nodemon to take advatange of its ability to auto update the server. An html.ejs file was used as a template to reduce the amount of code needed to get this app running. This method allows me to define something once and reuse it throughout my application. A back up index.html page was added for trouble shooting. The JavaScript handles event listeners, any get, post, put or delete requests. You will notice this when adding to the messages input and clicking on the thumb or trash icons.
